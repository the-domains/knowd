Greetings & Welcome.

My name is Dr. Knowd, founder of The Knowd - a place in space that helps people connect to resources. I've been quite eager to introduce myself to you!

The Knowd is a highly visual mobile and web app that makes searching
one's network for resources and making personal introductions between people
faster, trusted, and more productive.

You could say it is a platform for multi-disciplinary practices to collaborate. AKA you got something or need something, you can use The Knowd to find your missing puzzle piece. Groovy, no?

And psst.. if you're reading this, you are a select person I'd like to be among the first to invite to this project. I need your discerning eye to poke around and give me feedback. I'm showing off my first iteration, this is a working prototype -- I'll make improvements along the way, but would love as much feedback as possible along the way.  I know we have a long way to go.

What I need from you:

Sign up and create your profile.  

-Add a few friends through the secret handshake and create a hash orbit. What's that?  Sounds trippy.  A hash orbit is a "group" that anyone can connect to simply by texting the \#orbit to me.  But, you have to create one first.  Ask and you shall receive. 

Tinker and critique 

I'm in alpha stage and am planning to grow, but please understand this is just a working prototype. Please take a fine tooth comb and look through it, give me feedback on things that work or don't work for you. I want design, UX, and general feelings  from you. If you want to build something, let me know and I'll give you a hammer and nails.  

So, are you in?
