And it's happening "overground" - that is, where everyone can see it. We can witness it.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/415894ca6ddf8f40fdbfb5037b489e57d3b8b9e2.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>New Alzheimer's treatment fully restores memory function</h1><p>Australian researchers have come up with a non-invasive ultrasound technology that clears the brain of neurotoxic amyloid plaques - structures that are responsible for memory loss and a decline in cognitive function in Alzheimer's patients. If a person has Alzheimer's disease, it's usually the result of a build-up of two types of lesions - amyloid plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/4caf16b7b9b50bdc4d532f309d6c71e2433f2e39.jpg"></article>]]></description>
